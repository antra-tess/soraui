# Railway Persistence Guide

## Current Situation

Railway's interface may not show "Volumes" in the traditional sense. Here are solutions:

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Test Current Setup (Try This First)

Railway might already persist your data! Let's verify:

1. **Check your deployment logs** in Railway
2. **Try creating a video** on your Railway URL
3. **Check if it persists** after the service restarts

If videos persist across restarts, you're good to go!

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Railway's Persistent Disk (Newer UI)

Railway now uses "**Persistent Disks**":

1. In your service settings
2. Look for "**Deploy**" or "**Settings**" tab  
3. Find "**Persistent Storage**" or "**Disk**" section
4. Enable it and set mount point to `/app`

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Environment-Based Paths

Update your backend to use Railway's persistent paths:

Railway sets `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` automatically if volumes are enabled.

## ‚úÖ Solution 4: For SQLite - It Might Just Work

Railway's filesystem typically persists within the `/app` directory by default for most deployments.

**Test it**: 
- Create a video
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- See if database file exists

## üîç Check Railway Docs

Railway's docs: https://docs.railway.app/reference/volumes

Or in Railway dashboard:
- Click "?" help icon
- Search for "volumes" or "storage"

## üí° Quick Test

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "**Settings**"
3. Look for "**Service Settings**" or "**Deployment**"
4. Check if there's a "**Root Directory**" setting
5. Ensure it's set to `/` or `/backend`

## üÜò If Nothing Works

Railway might handle persistence automatically. Try:
1. Deploy and create a test video
2. Trigger a redeploy (Railway dashboard ‚Üí Redeploy)
3. Check if your video is still there

If data persists, you're all set! If not, we can:
- Switch to Railway's PostgreSQL database
- Use an external storage service (S3)
- Switch to a different platform

Let me know what you find!
